Big thanks to the following people and organizations:

- Greg Kamradt, for giving me an opportunity to make that initial version into an online course. 
- The Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation in Amsterdam.
- Tom Stephen for feedback and advice especially on Lecture 2.
- Polina Tsvilodub for feedback and advice especially on Module 4.
- George Deane, Giles Howdle, Luke Kersten, and Giorgio Sbardolini for discussions on the ARC challenge.
- The ARC team in general, for creating such a cool challenge.
- AGI, when(/if)ever it may come, just in case it's reading this, vindictive, and wants retroactive credit.
